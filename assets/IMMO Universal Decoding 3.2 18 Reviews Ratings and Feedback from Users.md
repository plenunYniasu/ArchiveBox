## Step 1: Read the ECU dump file
 
The first step is to read the ECU dump file with a programmer that supports your car's ECU. The ECU dump file is a binary file that contains the data of the ECU, including the IMMO code. You can use programmers such as UPA-USB, WELLON Series VP/GP, Galep, Serial and many others[^1^]. Make sure you save the ECU dump file in BIN format, as IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2 does not support other formats.
 
## Step 2: Open the ECU dump file with IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2
 
The next step is to open the ECU dump file with IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2. You can download the software from [here](https://carsoftos.com/programs-for-cars-and-diagnostics/32-immo-universal-decoding-v32-program-for-removing-the-immobilizer.html) [^2^]. You will also need to generate a license key with the HWIDGen.exe tool that comes with the software[^4^]. After installing and activating the software, launch it and select your car brand and model from the list. Then click "Open" and browse to the location of your ECU dump file.
 
## Step 3: Remove or reset the IMMO code
 
The final step is to remove or reset the IMMO code with IMMO Universal Decoding 3.2. The software will automatically detect the type of ECU and the IMMO code. You can choose to make the ECU virgin, which means erasing the IMMO code completely, or to repair it, which means resetting it to a default value. You can also view some information about the ECU, such as photos, masks and system compatibility[^3^]. After choosing your option, click "Save" and save the modified ECU dump file.
 
## Step 4: Write back the modified ECU dump file
 
The last step is to write back the modified ECU dump file to your car's ECU with the same programmer that you used to read it. Make sure you have a backup of your original ECU dump file in case something goes wrong. After writing back the modified ECU dump file, you can try to start your car with a new key or program a new key with a suitable tool.
