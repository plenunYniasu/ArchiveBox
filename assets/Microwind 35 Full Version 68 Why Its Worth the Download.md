CMOS technology has many benefits over other technologies, such as TTL and ECL, for CMOS design. Some of the benefits are:

1. Very low power dissipation: CMOS circuits have no continuous current path from the positive terminal of the transistor to its negative terminal throughout the circuit except the switching instants. This reduces the power consumption and heat generation of CMOS circuits[^1^].
2. Reduced circuit complexity: CMOS circuits require fewer components, due to which the circuit complexity reduces. This also reduces the cost and size of CMOS circuits[^1^].
3. Temperature stability: CMOS circuits are less affected by temperature variations than other technologies. This improves the reliability and performance of CMOS circuits[^1^].
4. Improved noise immunity: CMOS circuits have a high noise margin, which means they can tolerate more noise in the input signals without affecting the output signals. This makes CMOS circuits more robust and suitable for noisy environments[^1^].
5. High fan-out: CMOS circuits can drive a large number of inputs without degrading the output voltage. This increases the flexibility and scalability of CMOS circuits[^1^].

CMOS technology is constantly evolving and improving to meet the demands of modern applications. For example, CMOS technology has introduced FinFET and nsFET transistors, which are smaller and faster than conventional MOSFET transistors. These transistors enable CMOS circuits to operate at higher frequencies and lower voltages, which are essential for applications such as 5G communication[^2^] [^4^]. CMOS technology also offers various design tools and software, such as Microwind, that help designers to create and simulate CMOS circuits with ease and accuracy[^5^].
